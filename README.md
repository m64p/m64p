# Netplay

Starting February 2024, AWS (the hosting service used for netplay) is raising their prices[1]. Running the 4 existing netplay servers currently costs about $15 USD a month. This new price increase will basically double the cost.

I am left with 2 choices:

1. Remove 2 of the netplay servers (there are currently 4: US West, US East, Paris, and Brazil).

2. Remove IPv4 support (IPv6 only), which will make the service unavailable for some users.
